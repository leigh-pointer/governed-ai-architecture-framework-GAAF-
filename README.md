## Executive Overview

The Governed AI Architecture Framework (GAAF) defines a structural governance model for integrating Artificial Intelligence into enterprise systems without compromising architectural integrity, regulatory alignment, or engineering discipline.

GAAF is not an AI experimentation guide. It is an architectural control model.

It introduces invariant architectural boundaries, controlled AI interaction rules, enforceable validation mechanisms, compliance alignment structures, and cultural integration principles designed for enterprise environments.

The framework is technology agnostic and intended for:

* Enterprise Architects
* Technical Leads
* Governance Boards
* Risk and Compliance Officers
* Engineering Leadership

* * *

## Why GAAF Exists

Enterprises are experiencing structural erosion due to uncontrolled AI assisted development.

Common failure patterns include:

* Cross layer violations
* Domain leakage
* Architectural drift
* Untraceable AI generated changes
* Compliance exposure

GAAF defines a recommended invariant model that prevents AI from becoming an uncontrolled contributor to system architecture.

It establishes architectural boundaries that AI must operate within, not reshape.

## The Five Governance Layers

### Layer 1. Architectural Boundaries

Defines invariant structural constraints that prevent architectural drift.

### Layer 2. AI Interaction Rules

Defines where and how AI may participate in the engineering lifecycle.

### Layer 3. Validation and Enforcement

Implements measurable and automatable governance controls.

### Layer 4. Risk and Compliance Alignment

Aligns architectural controls with regulatory trajectory including EU AI Act considerations.

### Layer 5. Cultural Integration

Ensures governance is embedded into engineering culture rather than existing as documentation alone.

## Core Principles

1. Architecture must remain deterministic.
2. AI must operate within predefined invariants.
3. Governance must be enforceable, not advisory.
4. Compliance must be structurally supported.
5. Culture must reinforce discipline.
